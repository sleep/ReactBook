###[gitbook](http://www.gitbook.com).
GitBook is static content.

###[gatsby](http://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).
Gatsby is tuned for blogs. (verify?)
ReactBook makes no assumption about your underlying content (which of course is an assumption).

Gatsby doesn't seem to support React components within your document.
ReactBook does!
