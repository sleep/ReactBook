*...is a dynamically generated, multi-page interactive document (with live-reloading!!)*

<br/>


This is **reactbook**, a *proof-of-concept/template* of a multi-page interactive document.


The easiest way to explain is to take the following counter:

<div id="Test1">
<div style="display: hidden">
(React component goes here...)
</div>
</div>

It is a React component that gets injected into the page via [react-illiterate](https://github.com/sleep/react-illiterate)
